# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Focus and Theme
AI Systems in the Physical World. Embodied Intelligence.

## Goal
Bridge the gap between the digital brain and the physical body. Students apply AI knowledge to control humanoid robots in simulated and real-world environments.

## Quarter Overview
The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and understand physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.
