# Chapter 3: Why Physical AI Matters & Learning Outcomes

## Why Physical AI Matters
Humanoid robots excel in human-centered environments because they share our physical form and can be trained using real-world data. This represents a major step from digital-only AI to embodied intelligence.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- Master ROS 2 for robotic control
- Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
- Develop using NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
- Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
- Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics
